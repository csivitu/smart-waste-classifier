# Smart Waste Classifier

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Smart Waste Classifier** project.

## Overview

The Smart Waste Classifier aims to automate the process of sorting waste by leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. This project provides tools and models to classify different types of trash, helping improve recycling efficiency and reduce manual sorting efforts.

## Dataset

The model is trained using the dataset available at [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMN1Pp_pQo4-5zNE5SBQgLW_Wdsy96BV/view?usp=drive_link).

The dataset contains images of various types of waste, including:

- Glass
- Paper
- Cardboard
- Plastic
- Metal
- Trash

## Features

- Image classification for various waste types.
- Preprocessing and augmentation scripts.
- Training and evaluation notebooks.
- Model inference demonstration.

## Getting Started
It is ***recommended to carry out the execution/corrections using Google colab*** otherwise you may refer the steps below.
Note: the given code presents the case where you upload the dataset file to Colab and perform the executions. Alternatively you can skip the upload block.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation)
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`
